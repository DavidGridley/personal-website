        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows.</p>
        <h2>Current Projects</h2>
        <p>No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity. Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people.</p>
        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</p>
