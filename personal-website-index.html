        <h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
        <p>I have a varied background, having worked in manufacturing, catering, service and retail. Through all of these areas I have learned several core skills that are essential for any workplace; the ability to work well in a team, the ability to work individually on intuition, effective communication, attentiveness, attention to detail, and above all pride in ones work and the passion to succeed. In my personal time, I’m a musician, playing mainly drums and guitar; I’m an avid foodie, and I take part in weightlifting, wrestling and BJJ.</p>

        <h2 id="current__projects">Current Projects</h2>
        <p>I am currently studying Fullstack Javascript Development at Constructor Labs in London. I have chosen this path as I believe that coding is the most versatile and valuable skill in modern industry.  What I hope to take from the course are the development skills that, in combination with my experience in previous roles, will make me a truly valuable candidate for any company looking for an enthusiastic and studious Junior Developer to integrate into their team.</p>

        <h2 id="future">Future</h2>
        <p>In the future, I am looking forward to developing the skills I have gained at Constructor Labs and applying them to a variety of contexts, projects and challenges. I look forward to learning from, and contributing to, teams of likeminded individuals. Ideally, I would like to be able to be in a role that allows me to merge my acquired skills and my life-long interest in music in order to work on projects that help people easier access to music they enjoy, and create more interactive platforms for musicians and fans alike.</p>
